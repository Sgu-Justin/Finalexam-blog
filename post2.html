                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #1: Pay attention</h2>
                    <p>The significance of nutrition basics is often underestimated by many active adults, leading to a
                        shortfall in essential nutrients. Inadequate intake of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients
                        can jeopardize both health and performance. Adhering to the principles of a healthy
                        diet—abundant in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, whole-grain carbohydrates, and
                        sufficient fluids, particularly water—serves as a fundamental guideline for fueling up for
                        physical activities.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #2: Fuel up</h2>
                    <p>Providing your body with the necessary energy is crucial, even if weight loss is the objective.
                        Skimping on nutrition can result in muscle loss, reduced bone density, and fatigue, posing risks
                        of injury, illness, prolonged recovery, hormonal imbalances, and menstrual issues for women.
                        Ensuring an adequate intake of nutrient-dense calories supports both exercise and overall
                        health.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #3: Love carbs (you need them)</h2>
                    <p>Carbohydrates, often misunderstood, play a pivotal role in sustaining long and high-intensity
                        exercises. Research spanning the last 50 years emphasizes the necessity of carbs, especially for
                        active individuals. While some trends promote high-fat, low-carb diets, evidence suggests they
                        hinder rather than boost athletic performance. Carbs serve as vital fuel for the brain and
                        muscles during workouts, and the recommended intake varies based on exercise intensity and
                        duration.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #4: Rebuild with protein</h2>
                    <p>Protein is indispensable for its role in building and repairing muscles, providing essential
                        amino acids. Research recommends a protein intake of 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight
                        for very active individuals. Good protein sources include poultry, fish, soybeans, legumes,
                        eggs, Greek yogurt, cheese, and tofu.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #5: Don't ignore fats</h2>
                    <p>Despite confusion surrounding fats, they are essential for a healthy diet, offering energy and
                        aiding in the absorption of vitamins. Opt for unsaturated fats found in avocado, olive and
                        canola oils, flaxseed, and nuts.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #6: Know what you need pre-workout</h2>
                    <p>For workouts lasting less than an hour, eating throughout the day should suffice for energy
                        needs. However, it's advisable to avoid eating immediately before exercising to prevent
                        gastrointestinal issues. Generally, consume a meal one to three hours before a workout, even for
                        sustained, high-intensity activities like a half marathon.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rule #7: Remember post-workout 15</h2>
                    <p>After utilizing stored energy during a workout, prompt nutrient restoration is essential.
                        Research suggests consuming protein-rich foods within 15 minutes post-workout to provide
                        essential amino acids for muscle building and repair. Replenishing carbohydrates and fluids is
                        equally vital, and a post-workout smoothie can be an effective strategy for recovery.</p>
